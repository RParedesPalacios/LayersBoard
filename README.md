# LayersBoard
A layers web interface to manage experiments and datasets

# Install
To configure LayersBoard into your own server you need [Layers] installed into your machine. And also, you need an apache2 php webserver with MySQL.

Once you get those prerequisites, you will have to edit includes/config.php and setup your pathes: one public and one private folders. The public one will host your board.

Then, you just have to configure your database parameters in the includes/database.inc.php file.
